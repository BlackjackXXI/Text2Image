# Text2Image
### Generate images from text phrases with VQGAN and CLIP (z + quantize method with augmentations).
Notebook by Katherine Crowson (https://github.com/crowsonkb, https://twitter.com/RiversHaveWings). The original BigGAN + CLIP method was made by https://twitter.com/advadnoun. Translated and added explanations, and modifications by Eleiber # 8347, and the friendly interface was made thanks to Abulafia # 3734.

For a detailed tutorial on how to use it, I recommend [visit this article] (https://yourcriatures.miraheze.org/wiki/Help:Create_images_with_VQGAN+CLIP), made by Jakeukalane # 2767 and Avengium (Angel) # 3715
